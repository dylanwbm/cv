  <h3>Schools That I have attended:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Montana Youth Challenge Program:</li>
    <p style=font-size:16px>-This is where I obtained my GED or good enough diploma as we call it!</p>
    <li>Tongue Point Job Corps Center:</li>
    <p style=font-size:16px>-This is where I really started to get into PC's and other technologies. After completing the carpentry trade, I finished the Computer Support within one year of starting</p>
    <li>South Puget Sound Community College:</li>
    <p style=font-size:16px>-This is the last school that I have attended. Due to plans on relocating back to Montana for family, I am going to have to leave it. But do not worry, I am learning more with online
      classes than I did there. Plus I don't have to take all the "extra" classes. Like when will I ever use Astronomy in computer programming? When I'm hacking the moon?</p>
